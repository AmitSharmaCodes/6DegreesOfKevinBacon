1. 

In the file BSTNode.hpp you can see that the signature of the constructor is

BSTNode(const Data & d) : data(d)

Explain why parameter d must be a constant lvalue reference, rather than just a non-constant lvalue reference (assuming we do not have another overloaded constructor).

2.

 Notice that the BSTIterator class overloads both the pre-increment and the post-increment operators.  Why does the post-increment operator take an argument?  And why does the post-increment operator return a copy of the BSTIterator while the pre-increment operator returns a reference?
